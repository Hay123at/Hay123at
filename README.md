ðŸŒŸ About Me

Hi! I'm Hayat, a passionate and motivated Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Adama Science and Technology University. I enjoy turning ideas into real-world applications through clean, efficient code. 
My main focus is on full-stack web development, and I have hands-on experience using technologies like  React, Node.js,express, JavaScript,HTML, CSS and MySQL. Iâ€™ve also worked with WordPress and Figma to design and build responsive websites.
I'm always eager to learn new tools, contribute to exciting projects, and grow as a developer. Whether working independently or in a team, I love solving problems and building user-friendly digital solutions.
